This is my Final Project submission for this course.
Top-5 Accuracy: 0.13(13% of the time, the correct next token was in the top-5 predictions).
Generation:- Input: Artificial intelligence is advancing rapidly,
Output: Artificial intelligence is advancing rapidly, largely because advanced machines have become available to study and interact with data in unprecedented detail. Artificial intelligence is rapidly entering clinical, commercial, and military applications, and in science, medicine, and engineering. AI is becoming self

Due to the large size, pytorch_model.bin couldn't be uploaded on the model folder. You can download that file from here:- https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/3855a4scxgqtv75yh3jzq/pytorch_model.bin?rlkey=c5n0yx7gmy88zkde5qw9dlzyl&st=4vv1ze2v&dl=0

I saved result checkpoints after every 500 steps but couldn't upload them all due to their large size. However, here is one of the checkpoints (at step 500):- https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/13tt7afwmwb1bfubsob5g/AOzkvMRgi2-8GmlhW2Num-w?rlkey=oydghn2ladtc2x8q71c0zu09p&st=pflzten7&dl=0
I hope my project is upto the mark.

This is my Final Project submission for this course.
I had trained the model only on first 1000 data because of time constraints. I understand enough tme was given to us but due to backlogs, I couldn't handle it so there was a last minute rush and I had to reduce training data.
Due to the large size, pytorch_model.bin couldn't be uploaded on the model folder. You can download that file from here:- https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/f7a14hkoah9v76cxs7vhz/pytorch_model.bin?rlkey=t9a7ks25iw3pgn10xuz4meucs&st=a97um4lx&dl=0
I hope my project is upto the mark.
